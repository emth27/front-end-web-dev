            <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the
                use of
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.</p>

            <h2><span class="underline">Tools used for front-end development</span></h2>
            <p>There are several tools and platforms, such as <a href="https://wordpress.com/"
                    target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, available that can be used to
                develop the front end of a website.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="html">
            <h2><span class="underline">HyperText Markup Language</span></h2>
            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HyperText Markup Language
                    (HTML)</a> is the
                backbone of any website development process, without
                which a web page
                does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user
                clicks
                on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates
                text
                can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides
                an
                overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version
                of
                HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3C recommendation. This version
                contains
                new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files. </p>

        <section id="css">
            <h2><span class="underline">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span></h2>
            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets
                    (CSS)</a>
                controls the
                presentation aspect of the site and allows your
                site to have its
                own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are
                triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution. The CSS can be added
                externally,
                internally, or embedded in the HTML tags.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="javascript">
            <h2><span class="underline">JavaScript</span></h2>
            <p>JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language
                model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use
                the
                Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to
                events,
                like user input. </p>
            <p>Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web
                (independent
                of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly
                dynamic
                nature to the web page experience. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="webassembly">
            <h2><span class="underline">WebAssembly</span></h2>
            <p>WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and
                Microsoft), is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of
                plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in
                support). Prior to its adoption, there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in
                all
                browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet
                Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to
                asm.js
                and those browsers supported that way. Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or
                asm.js) directly, but use languages such as Rust, C or C++ or in theory any language, that compile to
                it.

                <p>The developer of the front end keeps these points in mind, utilizing available tools and techniques
                    to
                    reach this end.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>With continuing development for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, designers need to
                    ensure
                    that their site comes up correctly in browsers on all devices. This can be done by creating a
                    responsive
                    web design using stylesheets in CSS.</p>

                <p>Performance goals are chiefly concerned with render time, manipulating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    to
                    ensure that the site opens up quickly.</p>
